1) Both responses look the same, the only thing that changed was the txd_id. This is likely because both channel have the same permissions.

2) I get the respnse ("error": "ECI not found:) This is because the channel ID no longer has a valid channel accociated with it.

3) I recieve an empty array under directives as a JSON object. This is because it was unable to find an event for ecco/hello.
