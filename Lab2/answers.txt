3) Answers to the following questions:
If you wanted to create a new module for a different API, in which cases would you create another key module for the keys from that API and in which would you use the same key module? 

If I was creating an API that used twilio and required my personal keys for twilio, I would use the same module. If the keys were for any other site or service, I would make a new module for those keys. I would try to limit any key module to have the keys for only one service.

Why does this assignment ask you to create a function for messages but an action for sending the SMS message? What's the difference?

The sending of a message changes the state of the reciever, and so it is adviced to used an action. But the get request used for messages does not require a change of state and so is more suited for a function.
