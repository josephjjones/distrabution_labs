My new ruleset can be found at
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephjjones/distrabution_labs/master/Lab4/lab4.temperature_store.krl

1) Explain how the rule collect_temperatures and the temperatures function work as an event-query API.
    http://localhost:8080/sky/cloud/DWTzGk3L7saRezdMWindXq/temperature_store/temperatures
    This example query uses the sky cloud API which allows for the calling of a function 
    on a channel, but the query requires the rid for the ruleset and name of the function. (query api)

    The temperatures rule instead uses the sky event api and selects upon the domain
    and type of the event raised. (event api)
    

2) Explain your strategy for finding temperatures that are in range.
    I provided a function to get the entity variable from my base_wovyn
    ruleset, then use the filter function to compare the value from my list
    of temperatures to the threshold and only keep those less than the threshold.

3) What happens if provides doesn't list the name of the temperatures function?
    Then other modules that use the temperature_store module/ruleset
    are unable to call the function, any attempt to do so will fail.

4) What happens if shares doesn't list it?
    {"error": "Not shared: my_function"}
    The pico responds with an error that reports that the function is
    not shared and does not allow it to be called through a query.
